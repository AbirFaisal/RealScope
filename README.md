# RealScope
OWON VDS1022 Software Modification Project, Because having a USB scope should be like having a RealScope.

Working.zip contains a tested and functional version.


Tested on MacOS, you do need install the appriate the drivers though

To install with Homebrew on MacOS:
> brew install libusb-compat libusb


If the OEM software works on windows then this modified version should work as is.





For additional performance replace logo.png in com.owon.uppersoft.dso.image with a keysight logo.
Because its not about the scope you have its about the scope you feel like you have. JK don't do that.
